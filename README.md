# Machine Learning for Musculoskeletal Modeling of Upper Extremity

This file contains the code corresponding to the article "Machine Learning for Musculoskeletal Modeling of Upper Extremity".

A cluster was used to run cross-validation, so the code may require some changes to run on a laptop. Final model training can be easily done on a normal laptop. 

Test data for reproducing the results are provided here. The full training dataset can be obtained on request to vikranth.harthikotenagaraja@eng.ox.ac.uk

The codes are developed using Python 3 with [keras](https://keras.io) for ML.
